  ## Description

  Through this app the user is able to write notes with a title and body and save them in the side bar for later user. The Note Taker application utilizes JSON files to store and retrieve data. Using Heroku as the server host, information from the body is captured, stored and deleted in data base JSON files, through get, post and delete NODE Express server requests. The Node server using the Express package allowed for a seamless server requests that were able to locate the html pages, api calls and json files to capture and relay information. Path allowed for the server to effectively locate our json database while FS read and wrote the new information to our dummy database. Information from our JSON database was relaid on the front end through api responses and the web pages are updated using vanilla javascript.
